~~This plugin sends the server TPS and MSPT to players in the player list footer in such a format that can be interpreted by [MiniHUD](https://github.com/maruohon/minihud).~~

**Plugin development won't progress because a plugin that does this already exists: [TabTPS](https://github.com/jpenilla/TabTPS)**  
I tried looking for a plugin but didn't find anything which is why I started working on this but I've now found it so I don't feel the need to continue working on this. I should've looked harder. :(
